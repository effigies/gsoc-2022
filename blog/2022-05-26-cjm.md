# Welcome to the Nipype GSoC blog!

This year, Nipype was awarded three Google Summer of Code projects:

* [Adding BIDS Prov to new dataflow engine written in Python: Pydra](https://neurostars.org/t/21417)
* [Adding new workers and resource management to new dataflow engine written in Python: Pydra](https://neurostars.org/t/21418)
* [Converting existing scientific workflows to new dataflow engine written in Python: Pydra](https://neurostars.org/t/21419)

We're starting this blog where awardees can post about their progress
as they work on their projects.
